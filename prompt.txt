Please write a automation API testing framework which could test both REST API and WebSocket API, using the following technologies: 
- programming language: Python
- test runner: Pytest, Behave (BDD format)
- automation testing tool: Playwright
- need to implement data driven concept, to read request data from JSON file
- need a config file to change the base URL of different test environment: UAT, Production
- test report: Allure (need to display the test environment information)

Base URL:
- UAT:
	-- REST API: https://uat-api.3ona.co/exchange/v1/{method}
	-- Websocket (User API and Subscriptions): wss://uat-stream.3ona.co/exchange/v1/user
	-- Websocket (Market Data Subscriptions): wss://uat-stream.3ona.co/exchange/v1/market
- Production: 
	-- REST API: https://api.crypto.com/exchange/v1/{method}
	-- Websocket (User API and Subscriptions): wss://stream.crypto.com/exchange/v1/user
	-- Websocket (Market Data Subscriptions): wss://stream.crypto.com/exchange/v1/market

Note: 
- REST API requests need to be sent as "Content Type: application/json"
- REST API requests need API Key (api_key) for Production
- All numbers in requests must be strings, and must be wrapped in double quotes. e.g. "12.34", instead of 12.34.

demo cases in UAT environment:
- REST: https://{URL}/public/get-candlestick?instrument_name=BTCUSD-PERP
- WebSocket: wss://uat-stream.3ona.co/exchange/v1/market
	book.{instrument_name}.{depth}
	{
	  "id": 1,
	  "method": "subscribe",
	  "params": {
	    "channels": ["book.BTCUSD-PERP.10"]
	  }
	}

After you complete this framework and demo cases, please write a README file to introduce:
- how to set up the environment, which is pre-condition to run the tests
- steps to run the 2 demo cases: one is REST, the other one is WebSocket
- introduce the project structure
- how to write new test cases
- how to run and debug the tests
